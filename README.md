Hello Readers,

Nathanial here, here's a little about me. 

Degree: B.B.A. Management Information Systems ; Associate of Science, Geography

Current Position: GIS Analyst

Professional Interests: I really enjoy anything geographical. I have a passion for learning and understanding our world and the universe we live in. I like to help contribute to building a better and more efficient world for humans. I beleive that geography can help us understand much about the world and helps us think outside of our box and find better solutions to major issues.

Personal Interests: I am very curious and a tinkerer by nature. I strive to continue learning new skills, especially those useful in everyday life. I feel that there just isn't nearly enough time within my human lifespan to learn all of the things that I wish to learn and do. I have at least a little experience with programming, troubleshooting IT equipment, carpentry, masonry, electrician, plumbing, auto mechanics, operating heavy equipment, farming, and more.

Military: I was in the United States Army Reserve for seven years. In that time, I was awards mulitple leadership awards for the various roles I performed. I was Class Leader and Platoon Guide during my intial entry training; I worked my way up the ranks to a Sergeant, performing as a Team Leader and later as a Squad Leader. 

Personal life: I am a proud husband and father. My wife and I have been married since 2012 and so far we have two boys. My eldest son was born in 2014, and my second son joined us in 2016. If there is one place I want to be, it is spending my time with them. I am a lucky man to have a family as supportive, responsible, and easy going.
